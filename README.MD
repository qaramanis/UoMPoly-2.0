# UoMPoly 2.0

This repository contains the the UoMPoly Game build in Java as a project for the Software Engineering Subject at University of Macedonia

## Notes

The application can only be run using intellij or the packaged jar(not sure about that), because some of the UI elements use intellij's swing gui designer.
