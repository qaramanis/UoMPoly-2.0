This repository contains the UoMPoly Game build in Java as a project for the Software Engineering Subject at University of Macedonia

## Notes

In order for the application to be run by your IDE you'll need to add the [external library](lib/forms_rt.jar) to your project's classpath. 

And the jar needs [JDK Version 20](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-windows) to be installed.
